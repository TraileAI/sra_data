## Usage Examples

### Initialize Infrastructure Stack
```python
from packages.sra_data.infrastructure import (
    EnvironmentManager, DeploymentConfig, ProductionLogger,
    HealthMonitor, PerformanceMonitor, GitLFSManager
)

# Environment management
env_manager = EnvironmentManager(environment=EnvironmentType.PRODUCTION)
env_manager.load_environment()

# Production logging
logger = ProductionLogger(structured_logging=True, alerts_enabled=True)

# Performance monitoring
perf_monitor = PerformanceMonitor(enable_system_monitoring=True)
perf_monitor.start_monitoring()

# Health monitoring
health_monitor = HealthMonitor(enable_circuit_breakers=True)
health_monitor.start_monitoring()

# Deployment configuration
deploy_config = DeploymentConfig()
prod_env = deploy_config.create_production_config()
deploy_config.save_config(prod_env)
```

### Monitor API Performance
```python
# Automatic timing with decorator
@performance_timer(PerformanceCategory.API)
async def api_endpoint():
    # Your API logic here
    return response

# Manual performance tracking
perf_monitor.record_api_request("GET", "/api/users", 200, 0.15, "user123")
```

### Health Check Integration
```python
# Run comprehensive health checks
results = await health_monitor.run_all_health_checks()
overall_status = health_monitor.get_overall_health_status()
```
